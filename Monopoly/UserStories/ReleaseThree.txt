Release 3: Real Estate

Players can purchase railroads, utilities and Properties. When a player lands on unowned real estate, they immediately purchase it 
and the price is deducted from their balance (you can allow the player's balance to go below 0 or you can cancel the purchase if they cannot afford it).

When a player lands on an owned real estate, they must pay rent equal to the rent amount to the owner (assuming they are not the owner). 

When a player lands on a mortgaged property, nothing happens.

A player has the option of mortgaging a property or paying off the mortgage of a property at the beginning of their turn or at the end of their turn.

Properties: If a player owns all of the properties in a color group, the rent doubles. 

Utilities: If only one utility is owned, then rent is equal to 4 times the value currently shown on the dice.
If both utilities are owned (not necessarily by the same person), then rent is equal to 10 times the value currently shown on the dice.

Railroads: If a player owns one railroad, rent is $25. If a player owns two, rent is $50, 3 is $100 and 4 is $200.
