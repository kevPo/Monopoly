Release 5: Community Chest and Chance

Community chest and chance each have a single stack of cards. There is one stack of cards shared by all community chest locations
and one stack of cards shared by all chance locations. The order of the cards is initially determined randomly. Once determined,
the order remains the same (this iteration skips the get out of jail free card).

When a player lands on either of these locations, the next card (from the top of the deck) is removed,
the player must follow the instructions on the card. The card is the placed back onto the deck at the bottom.
